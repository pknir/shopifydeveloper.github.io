                <div class="faq-content">
                    <p>Hiring the best Shopify development company requires careful research and evaluation. Start by reviewing their portfolio to see examples of past projects and their expertise in creating custom Shopify stores. Look for agencies with experience in your specific industry and the ability to handle the scale of your business. Check client reviews and testimonials to gauge customer satisfaction. It’s also essential to assess their technical skills, including mobile optimization, UX/UI design, and SEO capabilities. Discuss your goals and needs with the company to ensure they align with your vision. Finally, consider their ongoing support services, as long-term partnerships often involve maintenance and updates after the initial store launch.</p>

                <div class="faq-content">
                    <p>Yes, Shopify can build your website. It is an all-in-one e-commerce platform designed to help businesses set up online stores quickly and efficiently. Shopify offers a range of customizable themes, drag-and-drop tools, and an intuitive interface that makes it easy for users, even those with no coding experience, to build a professional-looking website. For more complex or tailored requirements, Shopify also supports custom development through Shopify's Liquid programming language and third-party apps.

                    <p>Yes, Shopify can sell digital products. It offers built-in features and apps that allow businesses to sell downloadable goods such as e-books, software, music, art, and digital subscriptions. You can set up digital products just like physical ones, with the added benefit of immediate delivery upon purchase, making it ideal for content creators or digital businesses.

                <h3>Do big companies use Shopify?</h3>
                <div class="faq-content">
                    <p>Yes, big companies do use Shopify. While it is often associated with small and medium-sized businesses, Shopify is also used by large enterprises. Shopify Plus, a premium version of the platform, is designed for high-volume businesses and offers advanced features, scalability, and customization options needed by larger companies. Major brands like Allbirds, Gymshark, and Heinz use Shopify to power their e-commerce stores. Shopify's ability to handle large inventories, integrate with other enterprise software, and provide robust support makes it a popular choice for big businesses.</p>

                <div class="faq-content">
                    <p>Yes, Shopify does offer its own products, but they are primarily related to supporting the e-commerce experience. Shopify sells hardware products, such as Shopify POS (Point of Sale) systems, barcode scanners, receipt printers, and card readers. These products help retailers integrate their physical stores with their Shopify online store, creating a seamless omnichannel experience. Shopify also offers various subscription plans for access to its software platform, which includes features like website building, hosting, payment processing, and marketing tools. However, Shopify itself does not sell traditional retail products, as it is a platform designed for other businesses to sell their own products.</p>
