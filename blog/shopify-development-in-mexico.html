                <div class="faq-content">
                  <p>Yes, Shopify supports subscriptions through its platform by integrating third-party apps like Recharge, Bold Subscriptions, or Skio. These apps allow businesses to offer recurring billing for products or services. Subscription models are ideal for businesses selling consumable goods, memberships, or digital services. Shopify’s robust API makes it easy to manage subscription plans, track recurring payments, and handle customer data. With the rise in subscription-based businesses globally, Shopify provides the tools necessary to build and grow a reliable recurring revenue model.
