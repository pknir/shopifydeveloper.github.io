            <p>A <b>domain</b> name is your website’s unique address on the internet. In 2025, domain costs vary depending on the extension (.com, .net, .ai) and popularity of the name. Standard domains typically cost $10-$20 per year, but premium names can go up to thousands of dollars. Considerations like renewal fees, privacy protection, and registrar discounts also influence the final price. For startups, choosing an affordable yet memorable domain name is crucial to establishing an online identity. </p>

                <div class="faq-content">
                  <p>The cost to design a website for a small business in 2025 can vary widely depending on complexity, features, and who designs it. A DIY website using platforms like Wix or Squarespace may cost $300–$1,000 annually, while professional designers might charge $2,000–$10,000 for a fully customized site. Affordable options include template-based solutions or hiring freelance designers, which can provide quality at a lower price.
