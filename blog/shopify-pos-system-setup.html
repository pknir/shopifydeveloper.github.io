            <iframe class="iframehire add2" src="../offers/offer1.html" title="Offer"></iframe>
            <p><b>Web design expenses</b> include recurring costs incurred to maintain and enhance a website’s functionality. These may involve minor updates, content modifications, plugin installations, and monthly hosting fees. Businesses often treat such costs as operational expenses, deducting them in the year they occur. Treating web design as an expense is ideal for small updates or when the website does not significantly alter the company’s long-term operations. By recognizing web design expenses, businesses can benefit from immediate tax deductions and maintain cash flow flexibility. This approach is well-suited for startups and small businesses focusing on short-term gains. </p>
