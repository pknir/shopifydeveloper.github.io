                <h3>Which platform is best for eCommerce?</h3>
                <div class="faq-content">
                    <p>The best platform for eCommerce depends on your business needs. Shopify is ideal for small to medium-sized businesses due to its user-friendly interface and scalability. WooCommerce works well for WordPress users seeking flexibility. Magento suits larger enterprises needing highly customizable solutions, while BigCommerce offers robust features for growing brands.

                <div class="faq-content">
                    <p>The most successful eCommerce type varies by market but includes B2C (Business-to-Consumer), which dominates sectors like fashion, electronics, and beauty. D2C (Direct-to-Consumer) is also thriving, allowing brands to connect directly with customers, especially in niche industries. For recurring revenue models, subscription-based eCommerce is highly effective. In B2B (Business-to-Business), sectors like wholesale and SaaS continue to grow. Success depends on your business model, target audience, and ability to meet specific customer demands effectively.</p>
