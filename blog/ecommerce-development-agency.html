                <div class="faq-content">
                    <p>Choosing an eCommerce agency involves evaluating their experience, portfolio, and expertise in your industry. Look for agencies with a proven track record of delivering successful projects, especially for businesses similar to yours. Assess their technical skills, including proficiency in platforms like Shopify, Magento, or WooCommerce. Consider their approach to communication, project timelines, and post-launch support. It's also crucial to check client testimonials, pricing transparency, and their ability to integrate the latest eCommerce trends like AI or PWAs.</p>

                    <p>The best markets for eCommerce depend on your niche and target audience.

                    <p>An eCommerce marketing agency specializes in promoting online stores and driving sales through digital strategies. These agencies use tools like SEO, PPC campaigns, social media marketing, email marketing, and content creation to attract and engage customers.

                    <p>The best platform for eCommerce depends on your business needs. Shopify is ideal for small to medium-sized businesses due to its user-friendly interface and scalability. WooCommerce works well for WordPress users seeking flexibility. Magento suits larger enterprises needing highly customizable solutions, while BigCommerce offers robust features for growing brands.
