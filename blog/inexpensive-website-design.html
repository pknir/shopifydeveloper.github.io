                  <p>Websites can range from inexpensive to highly expensive, depending on the complexity, functionality, and customization required. Simple websites built with platforms like Wix or WordPress can cost as little as $100–$500 annually, including hosting and domain fees. However, custom-designed websites with advanced features can cost thousands to tens of thousands of dollars. In general, websites are not necessarily expensive if you use affordable tools and resources, but costs increase with specific needs or customizations.

                <h3>Are Website Expenses Tax Deductible?</h3>
                <div class="faq-content">
                    <p>Yes, website expenses are generally tax deductible as business expenses. Costs associated with website development, domain registration, hosting, and maintenance can be written off as necessary business expenses in many jurisdictions. If the website is considered an asset, its development costs might need to be amortized over time. Consult a tax professional for specific guidance based on local tax laws and your business type.

                <h3>How Much Is an Inexpensive Website?</h3>
                <div class="faq-content">
                    <p>An inexpensive website can cost anywhere from $100 to $500 annually. This includes a domain name (around $10–$20 per year), basic hosting ($50–$150 per year), and a pre-designed template from platforms like WordPress or Wix. If you’re building it yourself, the cost can remain low, but hiring a designer or adding premium features can increase the total cost.

                <div class="faq-content">
                    <p>The cost of an inexpensive website depends on its purpose and features. For basic informational websites, expect to spend about $100–$300 annually for domain registration and hosting, plus any optional costs for premium templates or plugins. E-commerce websites may cost $300–$500 or more due to additional features like payment processing and shopping carts. For an exact estimate, assess your specific requirements and platform choices.
