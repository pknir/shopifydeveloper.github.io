                  <div class="faq-content">
                      <p>Shopify development involves creating and customizing online stores using the Shopify platform. Developers use tools like Shopify’s Liquid templating language, APIs, and the Admin Dashboard to build and manage eCommerce stores. The process typically includes setting up the store, designing custom themes, integrating third-party apps, configuring payment gateways, and optimizing the store for performance and SEO. Shopify 2.0 further simplifies development with its drag-and-drop editor and advanced customization options. Developers can also create custom apps or use Shopify’s App Store to enhance store functionality, ensuring a tailored experience for both merchants and customers.<br>

              "text": "Shopify development involves creating and customizing online stores using the Shopify platform. Developers use tools like Shopify’s Liquid templating language, APIs, and the Admin Dashboard to build and manage eCommerce stores. The process typically includes setting up the store, designing custom themes, integrating third-party apps, configuring payment gateways, and optimizing the store for performance and SEO. Shopify 2.0 further simplifies development with its drag-and-drop editor and advanced customization options. Developers can also create custom apps or use Shopify’s App Store to enhance store functionality, ensuring a tailored experience for both merchants and customers."

        Manual Method: Add a new page (via Online Store > Pages > Add Page) and format it as a FAQ section using rich text or HTML.
        Using Shopify Theme: Check if your theme supports a FAQ template or an accordion feature for collapsible questions.
        App Integration: Install FAQ apps like HelpCenter, Easy FAQ, or FAQs Plus from the Shopify App Store.
        Custom Code: For more advanced FAQs, developers can use Liquid code to create dynamic FAQ sections that are easy to update.
        This improves user experience and helps address common customer inquiries effectively."

        Manually Add Related Products: Use product tags and collections to group similar items. Add these groups to the product pages as \"related products\" through the theme editor.
        Apps: Use apps like Frequently Bought Together, Upsell Recommendations, or Bold Product Upsell to automate related product suggestions.
        Customize Code: Modify your Shopify theme using Liquid to create a section for related products based on tags, collections, or categories.
        AI Recommendations: Use AI-powered apps for dynamic, personalized product suggestions, enhancing user experience and boosting sales."

              "text": "Shopify does not have a direct \"merge products\" feature, but you can achieve this by:
        
        Manual Combination: Create a new product that combines the details of the two existing products. Update the inventory and redirect the old product URLs to the new product using URL redirects in Shopify Admin.
        Use Apps: Apps like Matrixify (formerly Excelify) allow bulk editing of products, making it easier to consolidate details into a single product.
        Custom Code or API Integration: Developers can use Shopify APIs to automate merging products and updating inventory dynamically.
        Delete Duplicates: Ensure duplicates are removed after merging to prevent confusion."
