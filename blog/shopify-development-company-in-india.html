                  <div class="faq-content">
                      <p>Shopify development involves creating and customizing online stores using the Shopify platform. Developers use tools like Shopify’s Liquid templating language, APIs, and the Admin Dashboard to build and manage eCommerce stores. The process typically includes setting up the store, designing custom themes, integrating third-party apps, configuring payment gateways, and optimizing the store for performance and SEO. Shopify 2.0 further simplifies development with its drag-and-drop editor and advanced customization options. Developers can also create custom apps or use Shopify’s App Store to enhance store functionality, ensuring a tailored experience for both merchants and customers.<br>
