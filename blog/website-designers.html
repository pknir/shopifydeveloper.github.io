            <iframe class="iframehire add4" src="../offers/offer3.html" title="Offer"></iframe>
            <p>A "website under construction" page is often used when a website is being developed or updated. On GoDaddy, this feature can be added easily using their website builder tools.

            <p>Having two websites in one typically refers to a setup where a single domain serves two separate websites or sections. This could be achieved through subdomains, where each section (e.g., blog.mydomain.com and store.mydomain.com) serves a different purpose. Another approach is creating a multi-page website with distinct content sections targeting different audiences or markets. This kind of setup can help businesses manage different product lines, services, or geographical locations from one central domain. However, it requires careful planning to ensure a seamless user experience. </p>

                <h3>How much does a decent website cost?</h3>
                <div class="faq-content">
                  <p>The cost of a decent website depends on the complexity, features, and platform used. A simple yet professional website with 5–10 pages, basic functionality, and good design typically costs between $1,000 and $5,000. This price range includes design, development, and basic SEO. If you need advanced features like e-commerce, custom integrations, or a more elaborate design, costs can go up to $10,000 or more. Freelancers tend to charge less compared to agencies, but pricing varies based on the scope of work and level of customization.

                <h3>How much is the cost of a 1-page website? </h3>
                <div class="faq-content">
                    <p>A one-page website typically costs between $200 and $1,500, depending on the design complexity and the platform used. A simple one-page website created using a website builder (like Wix, WordPress, or Squarespace) can be done for as low as $200 to $500 if you do it yourself or hire someone for a basic template-based design. For a custom design, the cost can range from $1,000 to $1,500, especially if it's created by a web designer or developer who customizes the layout and adds unique features.

                  <p>The minimum cost of a website depends on the platform and the approach you take. Using website builders like WordPress, Wix, or Weebly, you can create a basic website starting at around $50 to $150 per year. This includes domain registration, hosting, and using a free template. For a more custom-built website or if you hire a professional, the minimum cost would be around $500 to $1,000, including a custom design and basic features.
