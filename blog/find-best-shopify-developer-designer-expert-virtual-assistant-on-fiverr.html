                  <p>Yes, many Fiverr sellers are legitimate professionals offering quality services. Fiverr operates as a marketplace that connects freelancers with clients, and the platform includes features like reviews, ratings, and verified profiles to help users assess a seller’s credibility. However, as with any online marketplace, it’s essential to carefully review a seller’s portfolio, feedback, and ratings before hiring. Communicating with the seller beforehand can also ensure that they understand your requirements. While there are many trustworthy sellers on Fiverr, exercising due diligence will help you avoid potential issues and ensure you get the quality service you’re paying for.</p></div>

                <h3>How Much Do Shopify Developers Make?</h3>
                <div class="faq-content">
                  <p>Shopify developers’ earnings vary based on factors like experience, location, and the type of work they handle. Freelance developers can earn between $20 and $150 per hour, while full-time Shopify developers typically make between $50,000 and $120,000 annually. Highly skilled developers working on advanced tasks, such as custom app development or large-scale store integrations, may command higher rates. Freelancers on platforms like Fiverr or Upwork often set competitive pricing, with project costs ranging from $50 for small tasks to $5,000 or more for comprehensive store setups. Earnings depend on the developer’s expertise and the complexity of the project.</p>
