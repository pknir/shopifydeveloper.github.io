                  <h3>What Percentage Does Shopify Take in the UK?</h3>
                  <div class="faq-content">
                      <p>Shopify charges transaction fees if you use a payment gateway other than Shopify Payments. In the UK, these fees range from 0.5% to 2% per transaction, depending on your Shopify plan. For example:
                        <b>Basic Plan:</b> 2% <br>
                        <b>Shopify Plan:</b> 1% <br>
                        <b>Advanced Plan:</b> 0.5% <br>
                        If you use Shopify Payments, there are no additional transaction fees, but standard credit card processing fees apply (usually around 1.9% + 20p for domestic cards). These fees can vary based on your plan and card type, making Shopify Payments a cost-effective option.
