                <div class="faq-content">
                  <p>The cost to design a website for a small business in 2025 can vary widely depending on complexity, features, and who designs it. A DIY website using platforms like Wix or Squarespace may cost $300–$1,000 annually, while professional designers might charge $2,000–$10,000 for a fully customized site. Affordable options include template-based solutions or hiring freelance designers, which can provide quality at a lower price.
