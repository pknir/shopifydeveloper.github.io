                <h3>How Shopify Dropshipping Works</h3>
                <div class="faq-content">
                    <p>Shopify dropshipping is a business model where merchants sell products without holding inventory. Instead:<br><br>
                        
                        A store owner lists products from a supplier on their Shopify website. <br>
                       Popular suppliers include platforms like Oberlo (now part of Shopify), AliExpress, and Spocket.<br><br>
                        <b>Key Steps:</b><br>
                        Set up a Shopify store. <br>
                        Use a dropshipping app to import products. <br>
                        Market the products to generate sales. <br>
                        The supplier fulfills and ships the orders. <br><br>
                        This approach is ideal for those looking to start an online store with minimal upfront investment.

              "text": "Shopify dropshipping is a business model where merchants sell products without holding inventory. Instead:
        
        A store owner lists products from a supplier on their Shopify website.
        When a customer places an order, the supplier ships the product directly to the customer.
        Popular suppliers include platforms like Oberlo (now part of Shopify), AliExpress, and Spocket.
        Key Steps:
        
        Set up a Shopify store.
        Use a dropshipping app to import products.
        Market the products to generate sales.
        The supplier fulfills and ships the orders.
        This approach is ideal for those looking to start an online store with minimal upfront investment."
